// Problem Statement: 0-1 Knapsack Problem

// Given two arrays v[] and w[] that represent values and weights associated with n
// items respectively. Find out the maximum value subset(Maximum Profit) of v[] 
// such that the sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to 
// Knapsack capacity W.

// Note: The constraint here is we can either put an item completely into the bag or
// cannot put it at all [It is not possible to put a part of an item into the bag.
